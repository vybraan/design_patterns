# Creational Design Patterns
Creational design patterns are a type of design pattern in software engineering that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The aim of creational patterns is to provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, making the code more flexible and reusable.

The need for creational design patterns arises from the fact that creating objects in an application can be a complex process. Depending on the requirements of the application, there may be several ways to create an object. Using creational design patterns allows developers to encapsulate the creation logic in a separate class or module, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
